# 3D_reconstruction
This project is a PyTorch implementation of 3D RECONSTRUCTION CODING CHALLENGE.

# Dataset
https://rgbd-dataset.cs.washington.edu/dataset/rgbd-scenes

# Point cloud
Use open3d to generate a point cloud from a RGBD image.

And then use SIFT, BFMatcher, ICP to register the point clouds.

The generated point clouds can be downloaded via the following link:.

# Mesh
Use 2 methods to generate a mesh from a point cloud: Poisson and Ball pivoting.
The meshs can be downloaded via the following link:.
